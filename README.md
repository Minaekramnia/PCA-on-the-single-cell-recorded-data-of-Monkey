# Dimensionality reduction analysis on Neuronal Responses in Visual Cortex 

State-Space Analysis of Neuronal Responses in Visual Cortex (V1, V2) during Perceptual Decisions
Neural activity in sensory areas reflects the physical stimulus but also the behavioral task, such as e.g. behavioral choice, attention and expected reward size. On the population level it is unclear how strongly these different variables are represented and how this representation changes across different stages in the sensory processing hierarchy. To address these question we recorded the single unit activity in two visual areas (V1, V2) during a perceptual decision task (stereo-depth discrimination of visual stimuli) [1,2,3]. In this project we plan to use statistical methods based on state-space techniques to analyze how both stimulus and task-dependent properties are represented in neural population activity. We used dimensionality reduction techniques and state-space methods to visualize the dynamics of neural population activity and their dependence on experimental covariates
